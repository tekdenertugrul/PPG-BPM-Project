# Photoplethysmography (PPG) Beats Per Minute Device

The PPG BPM Device, a senior design project, is in the category of biological signal processing. The device is based on Beer-Lambert law which relates to the attenuation of light properties of the material through which light travels. Using the device from various body parts like a finger, hand, and forehead, we can obtain relevant information that results in heart rate calculations.

We calculated
the heart rate values in a quiet environment and environment that includes slight movement artifact. Also, we can interactively plot four real-time graphs, which are raw signal, processed signal, power spectrum, and BPM values, onto the computer screen.

1- Note that the index.m is a simple Matlab code that calculates heart rate using real data.

2- Realtime.py is a python code that calculates real-time heart rate values using python. The digital data is coming from Arduino through the computer, and the program needs Arduino and the mobile sensor to work.
