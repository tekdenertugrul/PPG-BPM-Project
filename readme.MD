# Photoplethysmography (PPG) Beats Per Minute Device

The PPG BPM Device, a senior design project, is in the category of biological signal processing.
The device is based on Beer-Lambert law which relates to the attenuation of light properties of
the material through which light travels. Using the device from various body parts like a finger,
hand, and forehead, we can obtain relevant information that results in heart rate calculations.

We calculated
the heart rate values in a quiet environment and environment that includes slight movement
artifact. Also, we can interactively plot four real-time graphs, which are raw signal, processed
signal, power spectrum, and BPM values, onto the computer screen.
